## 🔒 What's NOT Included (By Design)

These files are in `.gitignore` and will NOT be uploaded:

- ❌ `node_modules/` (too large, users install their own)

- ❌ Log files

This is correct and intentional for security!

## ✅ What IS Included

- ✅ All source code

## 🌟 Recommended: Add a LICENSE

If you want to share this publicly, add a LICENSE file:

**MIT License** (most permissive):
```bash
# Create LICENSE file with MIT license
echo "MIT License..." > LICENSE
```

Or use GitHub's license picker when creating the repository.

## 📝 Optional: Customize README

Before uploading, you might want to:

1. **Update README.md** with your wedding details
2. **Add screenshots** (optional)
3. **Customize description** for your use case

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Safe to Commit
- ✅ `.env.example` (template only, no real credentials)
- ✅ Source code
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Configuration files

### NEVER Commit
- ❌ `.env` (contains real passwords and secrets)
- ❌ Database dumps with real data
- ❌ API keys or tokens
- ❌ Email passwords

The `.gitignore` file is already configured to prevent this!

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your project is **100% ready** to upload to GitHub. 

### Quick Upload Steps:
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create new repository (name: `wedding-invitation`)
3. Choose public or private
4. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Copy the commands GitHub shows
6. Run them in your terminal

Example:
```bash
cd d:\wedding-invitation
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wedding-invitation.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📞 After Upload

Share your repository URL with others:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wedding-invitation
```

They can clone and run it following the instructions in **START_HERE.md**!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Upload

**Issue: "Repository not found"**
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check the remote URL is correct

**Issue: "Permission denied"**
- Set up SSH keys or use HTTPS with personal access token
- GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens

**Issue: "Large files"**
- Make sure `node_modules/` is in `.gitignore`
- Run `git rm -r --cached node_modules` if accidentally added
